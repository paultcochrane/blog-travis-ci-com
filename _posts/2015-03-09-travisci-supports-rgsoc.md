Rails Girls Summer of Code has opened their
[fundraising campaign](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign) for 2015.

**Please join us in helping them support 20 sponsored students have an amazing
summer, working on great
[Open Source projects](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues).**

For those who may not know, [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)
is a program that funds and supports women around the world to work full-time
for 3 months on Open Source projects. Participants speak at conferences, attend
developer events, and get in touch with the wider Open Source community.

From Chicago to Cruj, Bangalore to Berlin, in the last two years 65 students
from 15 countries, 72 coaches, 27 open source projects, 52 sponsoring
companies, and 451 individual donors have come together to make the Rails Girls
Summer of Code happen. Some of the participating projects include: Rails,
Sinatra, Rubinius, Bundler, Ruby Documentation, RailsAdmin, Lotus, and Ruby
Object Mapper.

And Rails Girls Summer of Code works: over 90% of their alumnis are now working
in a technology related position, most of them as developers.

We think that is amazing work from an amazing community!

[Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/), along with
[GitHub](http://github.com), are partnering up to help make Rails Girls Summer
of Code happen.

Everyone who knows us well will know it's a project close to our hearts - not
just for the significant contributions being made to software used by millions
of people, or the life-transforming experiences had by the women who take part,
but also for the role models these participants become. This way Rails Girls
Summer of Code also functions as a long term learning goal for Rails Girls
students worldwide.

While we're extremely proud to support RGSoC we know the program would not
be possible without the generous support of other sponsors and private donors
from this amazing community.

**Please consider taking a few minutes to make a
[personal donation](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign)
towards the campaign, and convince your company to chip in with a sponsorship!**

*"I have a selfish reason for supporting Rails Girls Summer of Code: my
2-year-old daughter Erika. She loves lightsaber fights and sparkly shoes and I
want the software industry to be a great place for her to work by the time
she’s old enough, if that’s what she chooses."* -- Mark Madsen, Founder,
