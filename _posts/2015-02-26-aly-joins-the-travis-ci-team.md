We're super excited to announce that Aly has joined the Travis team!

Aly joins us as the second member of the "Pittsburgh office" where she lives in
the lovely east end borough of Greenfield, known for its spectacular view of the
downtown skyline.  She resisted the pull of the tech world for years, choosing
the path of the language nerd which led to her graduate work in Speech
Pathology.

Years of MMO guild management and IRC administration left her little choice but
to dive into the depths of software development, but she still manages to flex
her language skills in our team chat.

Additional fun Aly numbers include:

* 2 spoiled cats
* 2 spoiled guinea pigs
* 1 amazing Oracle DBA (who doubles as a spouse)
* 7 years old at start of photography career
* 8000 is less than her desire for multi-glot status <img src="/images/over8000.gif">

Important travel tip: Do *not* occupy the full width of an airport escalator or
conveyer with your luggage when Aly is behind you, unless you want to experience
some Twitter wrath.

Catch Aly in our [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/travis) and [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/sinthetix) as `@sinthetix` or take your chances
with her guild management skills on [ESO](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/),
[Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com), or
[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/).
