Brandon lives in sunny Los Angeles, with his wife, kids, and a puggle named
Sadie who ensures that no crumbs are left behind.

He's a self described life long computer geek, who found he enjoyed building
servers with Linux in High School and has been doing systems administration and
operations engineering professionally since 2005. Having worked in and on
production environments ranging from single servers to corporate offices to
managing websites serving the needs of 500+ million users and using AWS for
production systems since 2009, he's seen the upsides and downsides of
data-centers, the cloud, and everything in between.

Besides a passion for web operations and open source, he is active in the Los
Angeles and global DevOps communities, helping to organize [LA
DevOps](http://twitter.com/ladevops), numerous DevOpsDays Events, the ongoing
weekly [HangOps](http:/twitter.com/hangops) sessions, and the yearly [AWS
Advent blogging series](http://awsadvent.tumblr.com).

When he's not doing technical stuff or tweeting Adventure Time GIFs, he's
usually grilling for his family, reading *all the* scifi/fantasy books, or
napping.
