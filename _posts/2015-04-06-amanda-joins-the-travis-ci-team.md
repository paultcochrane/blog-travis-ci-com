It is a great honor to announce that Amanda
([@aquaranto](https://twitter.com/aquaranto)) is a part of the Travis team!

Amanda lives in lovely Buffalo, NY, USA, known for its otherworldly snowfall,
Niagara Falls, and close proximity to the mystical land known as <q>Canada</q>.

Amanda has always loved building and tinkering, and boasts a degree in
Manufacturing Engineering.  Her prior work experience includes several
disciplines including aerospace and electronics.  In the past few years, she
taught herself how to program and led a group that worked through [Chris Pine's
Learn to Program book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/).

Among Amanda's other interests are knitting and conference life.  She has been
an active yarn crafter for almost 15 years and runs the local
knitting/crocheting group in Buffalo. (She's on
[Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com) as <q>aquaranto</q>!) She spoke at the last
ever [Magic Ruby](http://magic-ruby.com) and loves to attend conferences so much
that she and her husband Nick ([@qrush](https://twitter.com/qrush)) headed up
[Nickel City Ruby](http://nickelcityruby.com/) in 2013 and 2014 (2016 NCRC:
Language Agnostic Edition coming soon?!?!)

Pro Tipâ„¢:  Amanda really loves Dr. Who, and has a mini 3D-printed Tardis on her
desk (alongside her 3D-printed buffalo).

the [Travis CI Twitters](https://twitter.com/travisci).  Be sure to say <q>Hi</q>!
