The thrill of announcements doesn't stop today!

We're excited to announce to the world that Lisa Passing has joined our team and
is going to help us to create a better user experience. She's already been busy
revamping our CSS and reworking our frontend (spoiler, great stuff coming
soon!).

Outside of learning new JavaScript frameworks, she enjoys sleeping, which she
can do pretty much anywhere, whether it be a bus, on a plane, a boat, or our
office couch.

She's played every game in the Final Fantasy series except for 11 and once had a
four hour argument with a friend on why the original Alien movie is better than
the sequels. Please leave your thoughts in the comments below.

Completely unrelated to this, Lisa was once dared to drink an entire liter of
milk, which she did. If this reminds you of [Joey on
Friends](http://giphy.com/gifs/friends-milk-joey-tribbiani-TsMnvSsfKzThu),
that's because Lisa was his inspiration.

Welcome, Lisa!
