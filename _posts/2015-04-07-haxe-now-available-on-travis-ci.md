Travis CI is gaining popularity among [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) programmers.
[Andy Li](https://github.com/andyli),
[CauÃª Waneck](https://github.com/waneck),
and [https://github.com/waneck](https://github.com/Simn)
have stepped up to the plate to give you
Haxe support on Travis CI as our latest addition to
the growing list of community-supported languages.

Haxe is an open source toolkit based on a modern high level strictly typed programming language, a state-of-the-art light-speed cross-compiler, a complete cross-platform standard library, and ways to access to each platform's native capabilities.

You can start your Haxe project as simply as:

```yaml
language: haxe
```

[More detailed documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/haxe/)
is also available.

Happy Testing!
