Openness is one of our core values at Travis CI, and we strive to improve on
being more open and transparent wherever we can.

A lot of our development happens out in the open, and you're more than welcome
to follow along. But what's been missing is a clear picture of what we're
working on at this very moment, what we've planned for the near future, and
generally getting a better overview of our product roadmap.

While there's a lot happening in our GitHub issue tracker, getting a clear
picture of what we're currently focused on isn't easy.

Today we're changing that by introducing our new [Travis Build
Site](http://next.travis-ci.com), our public roadmap of things we're working on
right now, things that we've shipped and what we have in the pipeline for the
near future.

We will keep this site updated, and we'll add more details in the near future to
make it easier to follow along.

[Have a look at the site](http://next.travis-ci.com), and let us know what you
think!
