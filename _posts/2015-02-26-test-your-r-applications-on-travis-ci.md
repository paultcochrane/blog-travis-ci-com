The Travis CI team is pleased to announce the availability
of the new community-supported language, R.

![R](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/200px-R_logo.svg.png)

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

The support is brought to you by [Craig Citro](https://github.com/craigcitro), the author
of the popular [R+Travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) application template
that allows R users to convince Trais CI to build R applications.

R users can now set `language: r` to join the Travis CI party!

[Dirk Eddelbuettel](https://github.com/eddelbuettel) and [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley)
join Craig in providing the community support.

** A stat joke goes here **

Happy testing!
