The Travis CI team is pleased to announce the availability
of the new community-supported language, R.

![R](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/200px-R_logo.svg.png)

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

The support is brought to you by [Craig Citro](https://github.com/craigcitro), the author
of the popular [R+Travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) application template
that allows R users to convince Travis CI to build R applications.

R users can now set `language: r` to join the Travis CI party!

If you are already using R+Travis, be sure to check out
[the porting guide](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis/wiki/Porting-to-native-R-support-in-Travis)
for migrating to the new R testing scheme.

[Dirk Eddelbuettel](https://github.com/eddelbuettel) and [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley)
join Craig in providing the community support. Thank you!

You can find out more about testing R software on [our documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/).
