Back in December, we [announced](../2014-12-10-community-driven-language-support-comes-to-travis-ci) community support for three new languages,
C#, D, and Julia.

Not long after, [Alexandre Ardhuin](https://github.com/a14n) started working
on getting Dart support.
Soon [Devon Carew](https://github.com/devoncarew) and [Seth Ladd](https://github.com/sethladd)
joined forces.

Today, we are excited to announce the [community support for Dart](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/dart).

Dart is a cohesive, scalable platform for building apps that run on the web or on servers.
It is developed by Google.

You can test it with:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: dart
{% endhighlight %}

See [our documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/dart/) for more details.

Happy testing!
