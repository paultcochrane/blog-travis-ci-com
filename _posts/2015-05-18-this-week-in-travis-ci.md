We have some exciting news this week!

## New Mac infrastructure is going into production

As discussed in our [last blog post](2015-04-20-state-of-the-mac-infrastructure-on-travis-ci/),
we have been working hard to bring the new Mac infrastructure to production.

Today, we are bringing it to production.

The rollout will be gradual, and we will be watching out for any sign of problems.

The switch to the new platform should be invisible to our end users.
If you do encounter problems, please <a href="mailto:support@travis-ci.com">get in touch with us</a>.

### Xcode 6.3

Some work is already in progress to get Xcode 6.3.1 on the new infrastructure.

We will be making announcement for this soon.

## The "Owner" page

We continue improving our web UI.

You can now navigate to [https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci)
and see the list of repositories belonging to the organization/user.
