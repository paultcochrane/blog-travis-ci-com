Howdy, folks! We (Josh, Justine and myself that is) are back from [Code Conf](http://codeconf.com/) in Nashville, Github's conference about open source culture and tech.

The two-day conference was packed with talks on all kinds of topics like diversity, culture changes in big companies towards more openness, new technologies, cool hacks and initiatives and much more.

Our very own Josh gave the opening keynote on Growing an Open Source Business, telling the Travis story and introducing [Travis Build Site](/2015-06-25-introducing-travis-build-site-public-roadmap-and-changelog/). All while wearing cowboy boots.

A special treat was the conference after party at the Country Music Hall of Fame that eased us into
the city's rich music scene.

Of course we also met a lot of nice people who, together with the talks put lots of ideas into our heads how we can improve Travis for you.
