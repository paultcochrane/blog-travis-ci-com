Howdy, folks! We (Josh, Justine and myself that is) are back from [Code Conf](http://codeconf.com/) in Nashville, Github's conference about open source culture and tech.

The two day conference was packed with diverse talks on a large range of topics. From open source outer space exploration to designing in the open, the spirit of transparency and openess was clearly the front and center of the conference. Other talks covered contributing oss projects, new (web) technologies and apis, licensing and community interaction and management.

Our very own Josh gave the opening keynote on Growing an Open Source Business, telling the Travis story and introducing [Travis Build Site](/2015-06-25-introducing-travis-build-site-public-roadmap-and-changelog/), our approach to sharing what we're working on more openly. All while wearing cowboy boots.

A special treat was the conference after party at the Country Music Hall of Fame that eased us into
the city's rich music scene.

Of course we also ate spicy chicken and met a lot of nice people who, together with the talks put lots of ideas into our heads how we can improve Travis for you.
