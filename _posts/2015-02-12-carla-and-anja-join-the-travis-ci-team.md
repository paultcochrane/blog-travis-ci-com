Today we're happy to announce that Anja and Carla have joined our team.

Both have participated in the first [RailsGirls Summer of
Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org) back in 2013, where they worked on
[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) and a project to visualize EU farm subsidy data
for the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.de).

Anja and her family live in Berlin. She loves science fiction books and working
on [Speakerinnen](http://speakerinnen.org) in her free time, a platform that
helps conferences find female speakers and moderators.

Anja is a regular at [Chaos Communication
Congress](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chaos_Communication_Congress), [Chaos
Communication Camp](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chaos_Communication_Camp) and the
local hackspace C-Base. You can follow her on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_tyranja_).

Carla hails from Australia, has Italian ancestry, and is currently residing in
Berlin. She enjoys taking photos with film cameras (you should follow her on
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/carladrago/) and
[Instagram](http://instagram.com/carlad), and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarlaD) too).

She used to make short films, [one of them was
screened](http://vimeo.com/38967051) at the MoMA in New York. Her favourite
Berlin blog is [...then we take Berlin](http://thenwetakeberlin.de/) and her
favourite Berlin bear is [Hungover
Bear](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-all-i-think-about).

We're thrilled to welcome both of them to our team. Over the past weeks they've
been busy improving the performance of our API and worked on making our internal
support tooling better, faster and easier to use.

Both of them work from our office in Berlin, so next time you come by, give them
a high five!
