Today, we are excited to announce our newest members of our community-supported
languages, Crystal and Perl 6!

## Crystal

[Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) is a programming language that focuses on developer
productivity, type safety, and execution performance.
It is statically checked and compiles to native (machine) code.
It combines global type inference, compile-time macros, compile-time type introspection,
automatic union types, and Ruby-like syntax, allowing quick prototyping and generating efficient computer programs.
It provides a Garbage Collector, uses LLVM as its backend, and doesn’t run on a Virtual Machine.

Support for Crystal is provided by
[Ary Borenszweig](https://github.com/asterite),
[Jonne Haß](https://github.com/jhass),
[Juan Wajnerman](https://github.com/waj), and
[Will Leinweber](https://github.com/will).



## Perl 6
